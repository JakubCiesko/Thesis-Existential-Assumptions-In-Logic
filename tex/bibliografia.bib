	abstract = {Alex Oliver and Timothy Smiley provide a natural point of entry to what for most readers will be a new subject. Plural logic deals with plural terms ('Whitehead and Russell', 'Henry VIII's wives', 'the real numbers', 'the square root of -1', 'they'), plural predicates ('surrounded the fort', 'are prime', 'are consistent', 'imply'), and plural quantification ('some things', 'any things'). Current logic is singularist: its terms stand for at most one thing. By contrast, the foundational thesis of this book is that a particular term may legitimately stand for several things at once; in other words, there is such a thing as genuinely plural denotation. The authors argue that plural phenomena need to be taken seriously and that the only viable response is to adopt a plural logic, a logic based on plural denotation. They expound a framework of ideas that includes the distinction between distributive and collective predicates, the theory of plural descriptions, multivalued functions, and lists. A formal system of plural logic is presented in three stages, before being applied to Cantorian set theory as an illustration.   Technicalities have been kept to a minimum, and anyone who is familiar with the classical predicate calculus should be able to follow it. The authors' approach is an attractive blend of no-nonsense argumentative directness and open-minded liberalism, and they convey the exciting and unexpected richness of their subject. Mathematicians and linguists, as well as logicians and philosophers, will find surprises in this book.   This second edition includes a greatly expanded treatment of the paradigm empty term zilch, a much strengthened treatment of Cantorian set theory, and a new chapter on higher-level plural logic.

 abstract = {A universally free logic is a system of quantification theory, with or without identity, whose theses remain logically true if (a) the domain of quantification is empty and (b) some of the singular terms present in the language do not denote existing objects. In the West, (inclusive) logics satisfying (a) and (free) ones satisfying (b) were developed starting in the 1950s. But Stanislaw Jaskowski preceded all this work by some twenty years: his paper "On the Rules of Supposition in Formal Logic" of 1934 can be regarded as containing, at least implicitly, the first universally free logic. The system proposed there is an inclusive logic as it is, and a straightforward extension of it is also free.},

The formal instrument does not specify the metaphysical counterpart of the relation between a symbol and its interpretation, nor does it tell you which things can or cannot belong to a domain of quantification. The formal instrument is neutral with respect to all these questions, and thus by itself cannot introduce any metaphysical commitments, existential or otherwise.",

abstract="The term `free logic', as introduced by Karel Lambert in 19601, is short for `presupposition-free logic' or, more explicitly, for `logic free of existential presuppositions'. Since existential presuppositions are connected with terms, this paraphrase was understood as `logic free of existential presuppositions with respect to its singular and general terms'. Modern logic in the sense of standard first order predicate or quantificational logic with identity (QL=, for short) is almost fully free with respect to its general terms or predicates, with one exception, namely universal terms or predicates like 'Px y ---Px' or `x = x'. In standard systems of QL=, `∃x(Px v ---iPx)' and `∃x(x = x)' are theorems. If we read such a formula as `something exists' this seems to express a matter of ontology rather than logic; taking it as a law of logic is therefore ``a defect in logical purity'' as already noted by Russe112. Giving up this presupposition results in a logic called inclusive logic by Quine3 or empty logic by some free logicians. The main concern of free logic was and is therefore existential presuppositions with respect to singular terms. In standard systems of QL= we usually have for every singular term t and every variable v the theorem 3∃(v = t). And in standard quantification theory without identity (QL) we still have for every formula A the theorem A(t/v) {\textrightarrow}∃vA and its dual∀vA {\textrightarrow}A(t/v).",

Lambert's PFL system is proven to be weakly adequate (i.e., sound and complete) with respect to that semantics by demonstrating that the concept of logical truth definable therein coincides with that one of common truth-value semantics for PFL. Furthermore, this state-of-affairs semantics resists the challenges stemming from the slingshot argument since logically equivalent statements do not always have the same extension according to it. Finally, it is argued that in such a semantics all statements of a certain language for PFL are state-of-affairs-related extensional as well as salva extensione extensional, even though their salva veritate extensionality fails.},

The models here introduced have only one (possibly empty) domain, and a partial reference function for the singular terms (that might be undefined at some arguments). Such an approach provides a solution to an open problem put forward by Lambert, and can be viewed as supplying a version of parametrized truth non unlike the notion of "truth at world" found in modal logic. A model theory is developed, establishing compactness, interpolation (implying a strong form of Beth definability), and completeness (with respect to a particular axiomatization).},

  abstract = {Free logics are a family of first-order logics which came about as a result of examining the existence assumptions of classical logic. What those assumptions are varies, but the central ones are that (i) the domain of interpretation is not empty, (ii) every name denotes exactly one object in the domain and (iii) the quantifiers have existential import. Free logics reject the claim that names need to denote in (ii). Positive free logic concedes that some atomic formulas containing non-denoting names (including self-identity) are true, negative free logic treats them as uniformly false, and neutral free logic as taking a third value. There has been a renewed interest in analyzing proof theory of free logic in recent years, based on intuitionistic logic in Maffezioli and Orlandelli as well as classical logic in Pavlović and Gratzl, there for the positive and negative variants. While the latter streamlines the presentation of free logics and offers a more unified approach to the variants under consideration, it does not cover neutral free logic, since there is some lack of both clear formal intuitions on the semantic status of formulas with empty names, as well as a satisfying account of the conditional in this context. We discuss extending the results to this third major variant of free logics. We present a series of G3 sequent calculi adapted from Fjellstad, which possess all the desired structural properties of a good proof system, including admissibility of contraction and all versions of the cut rule. At the same time, we maintain the unified approach to free logics and moreover argue that greater clarity of intuitions is achieved once neutral free logic is conceptualized as consisting of two sub-varieties.},

For this reason, a free semantics should provide, first of all, for a new conception of truth, or at least for a suitable generalization of the correspondence theory; but the efforts made until now have not achieved results which we can regard as completely satisfactory from a philosophical point of view.",

This chapter provides an overview of the concept of free logics. In classical predicate logic, each singular term must denote some member of the quantificational domain. Free logics annul this requirement. Their quantifiers, like classical quantifiers, are interpreted over a specified domain, but their singular terms may denote either objects outside that domain or nothing at all. If the quantificational domain is regarded as the set of existing things, free logics are logics whose singular terms need not denote existents. Just as modern syllogistic widens the applicability of Aristotelian syllogistic by accommodating general terms that apply to no existing thing, so free logic widens the applicability of classical predicate logic by accommodating singular terms that denote no existing thing. Free logics enable to do so by disallowing inferences whose validity depends on the presumption that singular terms denote members of the quantificational domain. This chapter discusses in detail about the empty domain and proof theory. This chapter explains basics of single and dual domains. A detailed discussion on positive semantics, negative semantics, and nonvalent semantics is also presented.}
