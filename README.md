# Bachelor Thesis: Empty Domain in First-Order Predicate Logic
**Existence Assumptions in Logic: From Classical Predicate Logic to Free Logic**

This repository contains my bachelor thesis, which explores the implications of removing existential assumptions from classical first-order predicate logic. I aim to assist anyone who is interested in this topic, whether they need literature, are exploring similar questions, or simply want to discuss these ideas further.

## Abstract

This thesis investigates existence assumptions in classical first-order predicate logic, where the domain of discourse cannot be emptyâ€”implying the existence of at least one individual in any chosen universe. There exists, however, a logic that does not require this assumption, allowing for empty domains. Quine referred to this as **inclusive logic**.

The thesis explores the transition from classical to inclusive logic, examining how the definitions of satisfiability change and how this affects the set of true formulas. Quine's procedure for determining the truth of closed formulas in inclusive logic is discussed, where universally quantified formulas are labeled as true, and existential formulas as false.

In the second part, the thesis addresses the removal of another existential assumption: terms in logic must not be empty. A logic that allows for empty terms is known as **free logic**. We explore various approaches to the semantics of free logic and its applications, including fiction, definite descriptions, set theory, and partial functions.

The ultimate goal of the thesis is to examine the consequences of gradually removing all existential assumptions from logic.
